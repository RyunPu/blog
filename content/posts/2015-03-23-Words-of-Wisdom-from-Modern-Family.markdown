We’re from different worlds, yet we somehow fit together.Love is what binds us, through fair or stormy weather.I stand before you now with only one agenda“To let you know my heart is yours”

我们来自不同的世界 但是我们彼此相容。爱将我们紧紧相连共度风风雨雨。我到你的面前只有一件事相许“我的心只属于你”



We do strange things for the people we love.We lie to them, we lie for them.There may be some bumps along the way,but we never stop wanting the best for them.That’s what makes it such a tough jop.Kind of the best jop in the world.

我们常常为了深爱的人做些稀奇古怪的事。我们对他们撒谎, 我们为他们撒谎。或许生活中难免坎坷颠簸, 但我们总希望他们过得尽善尽美, 就像是肩负着最沉重的负担。但却是世上最甜蜜的负担。



We tell our kids it doesn‘t matter if you win or lose, but let’s be honest, Winning feels pretty great.There‘s nothing like that golden moment in the sun.I think every parent probably wants that for their child.And maybe a little bit for ourselves too.Sometimes we push too hard.And that leads to a lot of resentment and guilt.So, how much is too much? Here’s where I come out.Guilt fades.Hardware is forever.

我们教育孩子们说输赢无所谓, 但是平心而论胜利的感觉好极了。他们在阳光下的那一刻是无与伦比的美丽。也许每位家长都希望孩子能有这样的时刻, 甚至希望自己也能这样。有时我们太苛求结果, 结果导致许多怨恨和愧疚。怎么才算不过分呢? 我的想法是愧疚总会过去, 奖牌才是硬道理。



Can people change? I don‘t know.People are who they are - give or take, yeah, 15%.That's how much people can change if they really want to.Whether it’s for themselves or for the people they love.But you know what? Sometimes that‘s just enough。

人会改变吗? 我不知道。人们总是本性难移 加减个15%吧。如果真的想改变的话最多也就15%, 不管是为了自己还是为了所爱的人改变。但是, 有时候这样就足够了。



Everybody’s afraid of something, right? Heights,clowns,tight spaces,Those are things you get over.But then there‘s our children.Will they fit in? Will they be safe? Those are fears you never get past.So sometimes all you can do is take a deep breath, pull ’em close and hope for the best.I mean, things don‘t always work out.But you gotta love it when they do.

每个人都有怕的东西, 不是吗? 怕高、怕小丑、怕窄小的空间, 这些都可以克服。但是我们还有孩子, 他们是否合群? 是否安全? 我们注定要担心一辈子。所以有时我们只能深呼吸, 拥抱他们, 希望一切安好。我是说, 人不可能事事顺心, 若事事顺心则要珍惜当下。



Nobody loves change, but… Part of life is learning to let things go.

没人喜欢改变, 但是学会放手也是人生的一部分。



We like to think we're so smart and we have all the answers.And we want to pass all that on to our children, but…if you scratch beneath the surface, you don't have to dig very deep to find the kid you were.Which is why it's kind of crazy that now we're raising kids of our own.But I guess that's the real circle of life.

我们喜欢自认为聪明, 自认为自己能解决一切问题。而且我们希望可以把这些传授给孩子们, 但是…如果你不只停留在肤浅的表面上的话用不着深究就能看到你自己儿时的样子,这也正是疯狂的地方, 现在我们自己都有孩子了。但是我猜这才是生命真正的轮回。



You can't have a successful marriage without being a good listener.

如果你不是一个好的聆听者那么你就不会有美满的婚姻。



People can surprise you.You get used to thinking of them one way, stuck in their roles.They are what they are.And then they do something that shows you there‘s all this depth and dimension that you never knew existed.

人们总会出乎你的意料。你为表象所蒙蔽 看惯了他们人前的一面。以为眼见为实。这时他们就会出其不意展示出自己深藏不露不为你所知的复杂内心。



Maybe we are the way we are because of the people we're with.Or maybe we just pick the people we need.However it works, when you find each other, you should never let go.

也许我们是因为身边的人才成为现在的自己, 又或许我们只是挑中了我们需要的人。不管怎么样, 当你们找到彼此就应该永远都不放手。



Everybody's got their stuff, whether you’re popular or a drama geek or a cheerleader or even a nerd like me. We all have our insecurities.We’re all just trying to figure out who we are.Don’t stop believin'

因为每个人都有自己的难言之隐, 不论你是人气王或是滑稽怪人或是啦啦队队长或者像我这样的书呆子。我们都有自己的不足。我们都在努力证明自己。永远相信自己。



There are dreamers and there are realists in this world.You‘d think the dreamers would find the dreamers and the realists would find the realists, but more often than not, the opposite is true.You see, the dreamers need the realists to keep them from soaring too close to the sun.And the realists…Well, without the dreamers, they might not ever get off the ground.

这个世界上有梦想家也有现实主义者。你可能会觉得梦想家们喜欢聚在一起, 现实主义者又聚成另外一个小集体, 但是往往二者喜欢混搭在一起。其实, 梦想家需要现实主义者提醒他们不要把梦想放飞的过高, 而现实主义者… 如果没有梦想家的话, 可能永远无法将梦想放飞。



Family is family.Whether it's the one you start out with…the one that you end up with…Or the family that you gain along the way…Which makes every day December 16th.

家人就是家人.无论是生来就血脉相连的亦或是相伴余生的, 又或是开枝散叶收获的小家庭。有家人在每天都是体验圣诞日。



They say the important thing in life isn‘t the destination.It’s the journey, the challenges you face along the way, the unexpected twists and turns, the disappointments you overcome.

世人常说 生命中最重要的事并非抵达终点。而是旅途本身, 是一路上遇到的重重挑战, 是出乎意料的峰回路转, 是被你击溃的失望和沮丧。



If you’re ever feeling lonely, Just eat in front of a mirror.

如果你感到孤单, 就在镜子前吃饭吧。



Never be afraid to reach for the stars, because even if you fall, you’ll always be wearing a parent-chute, TM

永远不要害怕摘星星, 因为就算你跌下来, 你永远有“父母牌降落伞”防身, 注册专利。



I've always seen life like a series of doors.Sometimes you get to choose the door you go through, Sometimes you don‘t get that choice.But you still gotta walk through.So you can either go kicking and screaming or walk through with your head held high.

我总把生活看做由许多道门组成。有时候你得选择你要穿过哪道门, 有时候你根本无从选择, 但你还是得穿过去。所以你可以去猛敲门或者叫门, 或者趾高气昂地穿过。



Sometimes I don't understand people .They do crazy things for the dumbest reasons.They convince themselves it'll all work out.Despite all the evidence to the contrary.Which I guess isn't so bad.

有时候我不太理解人类, 他们因为最傻的原因做出疯狂的事, 他们说服自己无论怎样都会有好结果, 他们会无视所有相反的证据, 我想也不算太差吧。



There's kinds of milestones in life,The kind you expect to live through —— The first kiss、Birthdays、Graduations.If you're lucky,a wedding or two.Or even a new addition to the family.Then there's the kind you never dreamed you'd get to live through again.And that's the best kind of all.

人生中有着各种里程碑, 有你期望经历的——初吻、生日、毕业。如果够幸运, 一两次婚礼, 甚至是家里增添了新成员。还有你从未梦想过会再次经历的时刻。那才是人生中最美妙的。



What qualifies someone as a hero?Obviously,a hero has to be someone we respect.A person we look up to.A person who is generous of spirit.Who's willing to grow and learn.Maybe it's the person  you love most in the world or the guy who makes the most out of life,no matter what anyone thinks.For me,though,The hero in my family is my family,because of who we are together.

什么样的人才有资格被称为英雄?显然, 英雄必须是我们尊敬的人, 我们敬仰的人, 心胸宽广的人, 愿意成长与学习的人, 也许是这世上你最爱的人, 或是尽力享受生活的人, 无论别人怎么想。不过对我来说, 我家里的英雄是我的家人, 我们在一起才是英雄。 



We all weave a web of lies.Some we tell to try to help the ones we love.Some we tell to try to fool ourselves.And some we tell because when you're out of bullets and staring down the barrel of a kalashnikov,the only weapon you've got left is guile.

我们都在编织着谎言之网, 有些谎言是为了帮助所爱的人。有些谎言是为了欺骗自己。有些谎言是因为当子弹用尽凝视着冲锋枪的枪管时剩下的武器只有诡计。 



This is a lighter.It belonged to my favorite actor,Paul Newman.One day, he came into the restaurant where I was waitressing and accidentally left it behind.For the first time in my life,I did something I wasn't supposed to and slipped it into my pocket.One of the customers saw and said,"don't worry.Your secret's safe with me"That customer turned out to be the love of my life,your grandfather.So,my,Alex,who I love so dearly,who is probably too much like me for her own good,every once in a while,don't be afraid to break the rules.You never know what can happen.

这是一个打火机, 原本属于我最喜欢的演员保罗纽曼。有一天, 他来我做服务员的餐厅就餐不小心落下了, 我这辈子第一次做了不应该做的事, 将之据为己有。有一位客人看到了, 说“别担心, 我会帮你保守秘密”。那位客人后来成为了我的毕生挚爱, 你的爷爷。所以, 我最爱的Alex, 可能你太像我了, 虽然这也挺好, 但偶尔的, 不要害怕打破常规, 你永远不知道会发生什么好事。



Life isn't easy.Sometimes we just need a little help,getting your confidence back,getting on the same page,getting out of your own way,or just getting moving.

生活并不容易。有时候我们只是需要一点点帮助来重拾自信, 来默契统一, 来释放自己, 或者就是运动起来。



People love getting new things,but the best stuff has a story behind it.A lot of times,it's only after we get rid of something that we realize how much we miss it.And things that seem worthless suddenly turn out to be super valuable maybe even precious

人们都喜欢得到新东西, 不过最好的东西背后都有故事。很多时候, 只有当我们失去了之后才知道自己有多想念。看起来没什么价值的东西突然就变得很有价值甚至是宝贵。



We all want people to think the best of us, so sometimes we cover things up to protect ourselves.But we don't have to be afraid,because the truth is always a good thing.The truth sets us free,brings us closer.

我们都希望别人看到自己最好的一面, 所以有时我们会隐藏一些事以保护自己。但我们不必害怕, 因为真相永远是一件好事。真相让我们自由, 让我们更亲近。



It’s scary to let people see the real you,even when those people are your own family.But aren’t they the ones we should be least worried about,the ones who will love us without judging, who forgive our faults and celebrate our imperfections?Maybe even encourage us to let our true selves shine through?

让人们见到真实的你是很可怕的一件事, 即使是面对你最亲的家人亦是如此。但其实我们最不该担心他们的态度, 因为他们是不带偏见爱我们的人, 他们会原谅我们的过错, 庆祝我们的不完美, 甚至会鼓励我们尽情展现真实的自己。



No one wins anything without help from family and friends who steer you away from bad ideas and toward good ones.Because every time anyone accomplishes anything…he or she achieves it with the help of a thousand silent heroes.the selfless team players who offer their support not to be recognized but because it's the right thing to do.

一个人如果要成事就需要家人和朋友的帮助指引你丢掉错的想法并作出对的选择。因为每个人的成功, 背后都有无数个沉默的英雄无私的伙伴伸出他们的援手并不是为了被认可而是因为那是对的事。
